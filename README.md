SpaceTravelBudget

Boba Fett has awoken from a Hypersleep in our solar system and doesn't have enough Zenny to buy Warp Cells to allow him to travel back to his home planet of Kamino. He has been forced to bounty hunt in our solar system and has decided to make a budgeting app to help track his space credits (Zenny) and save enough money to return home.

Boba has hired the services of CodeClan to create an app for his Watchie-Talkie to create new Transactions ( which should include a planet name, merchant name, e.g. Mos Eisley Cantina 2 on Mars, and space credit (Zenny) cost ) which have an associated Tag (e.g. 'Rocket fuel', 'Oxygen Tanks', 'Space Food', 'Additional Nets for Net Gun'). The app would then be able to track a total, and display this in a view.

MVP: Create new transactions Display a list of all transactions Display total amount spent Display total amount spent by tag Possible Extensions: CRUD actions for the transactions Show a warning when the total expenditure is over budget (set a hard coded budget first) Add a date to the transactions and view total spending by month Any other ideas you might come up with
