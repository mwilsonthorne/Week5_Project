# Week5_Project
A full stack development project using Ruby, SQL, Sinatra, HTML and CSS to construct a CRUD application to allow a user to monitor their transactions, display total amount spent and by description. The user can also have a budget limit which the system will recognise when the budget has been exceeded.
